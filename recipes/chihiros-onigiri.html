        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Onigiri is a Japanese dish, typically consisting of rice, nori (seaweed), and some sort of filling. There are many variations of onigiri, but this one will be fairly simple with a tuna-mayo filling. This recipe was inspired by Studio Ghibli's <em>Spirited Away</em>, although the onigiri seen in the movie appeared to simply consist of rice. We'll make this onigiri a little more appetizing with a couple simple additions.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 mini sheets of nori (seaweed)</li>
            <li>One can of tuna</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 cups cooked sticky rice, lukewarm</li>
            <li>An onigiri mold <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice your nori sheets into your desired length, as you'll be wrapping these around your onigiri later.</li>
            <li>Combine tuna and mayonnaise to taste.</li>
            <li>Take your lukewarm rice and press it into the onigiri mold (or your hands if not using a mold), leaving room for the filling.</li>
            <li>Insert desired amount of filling.</li>
            <li>Add additional rice to cover, and then press to form onigiri shape.</li>
            <li>Wrap in onigiri strips.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
